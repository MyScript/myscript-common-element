# [v2.0.0](https://github.com/MyScript/myscript-common-element/tree/v2.0.0)

## Features
- New events to be notified of editor changes.
- New `strokecolor` and `strokewidth` attributes. Used to change current writing style. 
- New `unloaded` flag to control component state. `load` event will be trigger once the editor will be fully loaded.
- New **not mutable** `configuration` attribute. Changing the configuration will clear the underlying editor, all currents strokes and results will be lost. To do it, set `unloaded=true` after changing configuration, and wait for a `load` event.
- New **read-only** `editor` property that allow you to access to the underlying editor object (see [MyScriptJS documentation]() for more details).
- New CSS variables to customize the web-component. See [demo/customstyle.html](demo/customstyle.html) as an example.
 
## Breaking changes
- Complete rewrite of the underlying javascript library with ES6 syntax
- Internal design improved to allow extensibility and support of upcoming recognition types. Documentation and illustrating samples to come in next release. 
- Removal of all deprecated attributes and methods
- All events has been renamed. See the [documentation](./docs/index.html) to discover new behavior.
- `resulttypes`, `language`, `typeset`, `textparameters`, `mathparameters`, `shapeparameters`, `musicparameters`, `analyzerparameters` are replaced by the unique `configuration` attribute (see [MyScriptJS documentation]() for a complete spec).
- Renamed `timeout` attribute to `recognitiontriggerdelay`
- Renamed `delete()` property to `clear()`
- Changed `ssl` attribute to a `scheme` attribute (i.e. `ssl=true` will be replaced by `scheme=https`)
- `getAvailableLanguages()` have been replaced by a new web-component. You can use it to retrieve the list of available languages for your configuration.

##Â Bugs
- User can no longer write when an unrecoverable error is detected forcing him to reload the page. See [demo/init-error.html](.demo/init-error.html) to see how it works.

For more details about attributes, look at the [documentation](./docs/index.html).

## Limits
- `myscript-common-element` does not support pure shadow DOM. Still some issues to use underlying css.

`myscript-common-element` is the common layer of [myscript-math-web](https://github.com/MyScript/myscript-math-web) and [myscript-text-web](https://github.com/MyScript/myscript-text-web). 
It helps you to integrate an ink editor and handwriting recognition in your **Polymer** webapp.
 
## What is it about?

myscript-common-element is a web component that can be used in every web application to bring handwriting recognition and conversion. It integrates all you need:
* Signal capture,
* Digital ink rendering,
* Rich editing gestures,
* Conversion,
* Import,
* Exports.

Both math and text can be recognized, you just have to define the appropriate configuration settings.

If you are not familiar with webcomponents and Polymer, please use [MyScriptJS](https://github.com/MyScript/MyScriptJS) or [myscript-math-web](https://github.com/MyScript/myscript-math-web) and [myscript-text-web](https://github.com/MyScript/myscript-text-web).
